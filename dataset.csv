b'81',"npsimun hjcc uk post-conference feedback dear delegate , we hope this email finds you well . it was an extremely fulfilling experience for us , and we hope that we were able to satisfactorily perform our role as the dais . please find below the feedback we have written for you , and we hope that this can help you improve for your future conferences . feedback : * content : * whatever you spoke about , it happened to be detailed and without a huge compromise on precision . you made certain interesting points throughout the conference but came up short in consolidating them effectively in speeches . not many of your best points were seen in some of the successful documentation passed , ultimately rendering that portion of your content unfortunately redundant . * confidence & delivery in speeches : * you can try to improve voice modulation , usage of tone , volume , and pauses , to emphasize the key points of delivery . you were one of the best raw speakers on the committee and an increase in volume might help assert further dominance in the future . * lobbying : * you were actively participating in most of the unmoderated caucuses you were given a chance to lobby in . further use of informal lobby time like break timings is recommended . * adherence to stance : * you should be more mindful of your portfolio powers , and exercise them accordingly . example : the agriculture minister should talk about stockpiling resources and submitting related directives and the commander of the air force should order the mobilization of the air force . use personal directives more liberally to get as much information from the backroom regarding statistics and the powers of your portfolio . it may not always work , but it will be beneficial in the long run . especially as the foreign secretary , your role was heavily reliant on diplomatic measures to alleviate all the threats the cabinet could face , which the dais felt was not adequately addressed . * document writing : * while writing directives , pay close attention to the minute details . ask yourself questions such as where is this action being done , when is it being done , what is it trying to accomplish , how is it going to be carried out , who is going to carry it out , who is going to be affected , and how many resources are being used ? in addition to this , format it very carefully while focussing on the grammar , format , font , size , and order of clauses ; the less ambiguous your directive is , the less likely backroom is to misinterpret or vaguely interpret the directive , and this will lead to good outcomes for your cabinet . * presence in committee : * you were a moderately active participant in most committee sessions , which is commendable . you could look to raise more motions and use the rop more intricately however to try and impose your authority even further during council sessions . we wish you all the best for the future and hope to see you continue your journey in debate . yours sincerely , the dais hjcc uk , garladinne aditya and tarun shankar .",0
