This year's team of directors have chosen you to become a part of the Business Development Committee! I am excited to begin working with all of you and for all of you to get started and familiar with the race tools. This email is going to be LONG but don't get intimidated. Please go through this very slowly and carefully. *Step 1: Activate your Email and Slack * I have set up your @24hourrace.org email address, which is to be used for 24hourrace.org *all* 24 Hour Race related matters. We need to adhere to this protocol in order to 1. create a uniform and professional impression for all external contacts and 2. have access to several tools via your @ 24hourrace.org domain. All of you should have received an email regarding your new 24 Hour Race account. Please check your spam folders in the case of the email landing there. If you haven't received it yet, please let me know asap so I can re-send it to you. After you have created your account, please add a signature to your new email address in the following format: Please set up a signature in your new email addresses per the following format: + year] Website Facebook Feel free to customize these signatures with personal mottos, emoji, etc\u2026 Make it a piece of you! Once you have logged-in for the first time, you'll be prompted to reset your password. You can login simply by visiting gmail.com and entering your full email address and password. If you have any issues let me know. After you are logged in, you will need to download Slack Slack is a powerful communications tool that we will use internally at the 24HR. It is often used by many companies for instant messaging purposes. It also has useful programs integrated inside so click around. To login to Slack, simply visit 24hourrace.slack.com and use your new @ 24hourrace.org credentials to create an account! Dead simple . When you've figured it out send me and Reeti a Slack message! It's very hard for me to emphasize this but time will tell\u2026 Communication is key. You must use Slack vigorously, using the various web and mobile apps, ensuring notifications are enabled and that you *understand* how the app actually works. Take time to get to know your counterparts in different countries, discuss ideas/strategies, always be learning.\u2026 Respond promptly, always. *Please download the mobile app on your phone so you can communicate on-the-go. * There are a few more role-specific tools but we'll introduce you to these early next week. Stay tuned. *Step 2: Download Notion and familiarise yourself with all of our tools* Notion is the information centre. There will be information about your specific roles, extensive checklists, objectives, a lot of resources, examples, etc etc etc etc etc. You can use Notion on your web browser but I recommend downloading the software on your computer or mac. You'll need to log in using your 24hourrace.org email. Search for the 24 Hour Race Workspace in the top left corner. You'll already have access to your specific Workspace called 'Director Playbook 2.0'. Please let me know if you can't see or are having trouble with this. The first you need to do so is go to 'Tools & Training' under *Getting Started *and WATCH ALL OF THE VIDEOS. Those are the tools you'll be using so much over the course of this race that you'll be dreaming about them. Then familiarise yourself with the rest of the content in Notion. Go through the other Director's responsibilities and tasks as well. *Step 3: Airtable* After watching the Airtable video in Notion go to Once you've created your log in using your 24hourrace email there should be a Workspace simply named by the name of your city i.e. 'Singapore'. Click into it. You'll be using this\u2026 a lot\u2026 This is your Project Management tool. Familiar yourself with the Project Management Airtable and get an overview of the general timeline, tasks, deadlines, etc. *Step 4: Watch these videos* Video preview image] 24 Hour Race | Who Are We, What Do Student Directors & Leaders Do? youtube.com Mixmax] Video preview image] 24 Hour Race Kuala Lumpur 2019 youtube.com Mixmax] *Step 5: Get Started!* Talk to the directors. Ask them what you can do. Take initiative. Take leadership and come up with ideas, ask questions, and make this race your own. But do remember, the Directors are leading this race and if this were a company they would be your bosses. So respect them, but often times the best way of showing respect is by being a proactive member. Good job on making it all the way down here! That was a lot of information with plenty to do in a short amount of time. The tools, videos, this email - it may all seem overwhelming right now and that is completely understandable Go over the tools and material till you get an understanding of it all and you'll soon realise that is user-friendly and simple to work with. The 24 Hour Race experience is like this: chaotic, busy, but so so worth it. You have become a committee member because you carry qualities others don't. Be confident. Be creative. Give it your all. Victims of Slavery across the globe are relying on you. We are, for a lot of people locked in slavery today; their only hope. We are a group of young, optimistic, hopeful people who believe we can make a difference. And every now and then we do. There are lives that directly depend on your work as a committee member.

It was an extremely fulfilling experience for us, and we hope that we were able to satisfactorily perform our role as the Dais. Please find below the feedback we have written for you, and we hope that this can help you improve for your future conferences. Feedback: *Content:* Whatever you spoke about, it happened to be detailed and without a huge compromise on precision. You made certain interesting points throughout the conference but came up short in consolidating them effectively in speeches. Not many of your best points were seen in some of the successful documentation passed, ultimately rendering that portion of your content unfortunately redundant. *Confidence & Delivery in Speeches:* You can try to improve voice modulation, usage of tone, volume, and pauses, to emphasize the key points of delivery. You were one of the best raw speakers on the committee and an increase in volume might help assert further dominance in the future. *Lobbying:* You were actively participating in most of the unmoderated caucuses you were given a chance to lobby in. Further use of informal lobby time like break timings is recommended. *Adherence to Stance:* You should be more mindful of your portfolio powers, and exercise them accordingly. Example: The Agriculture minister should talk about stockpiling resources and submitting related directives and the Commander of the Air Force should order the mobilization of the Air Force. Use Personal Directives more liberally to get as much information from the backroom regarding statistics and the powers of your portfolio. It may not always work, but it will be beneficial in the long run. Especially as the foreign secretary, your role was heavily reliant on diplomatic measures to alleviate all the threats the cabinet could face, which the dais felt was not adequately addressed. *Document Writing: *While writing directives, pay close attention to the minute details. Ask yourself questions such as where is this action being done, when is it being done, what is it trying to accomplish, how is it going to be carried out, who is going to carry it out, who is going to be affected, and how many resources are being used? In addition to this, format it very carefully while focussing on the grammar, format, font, size, and order of clauses; the less ambiguous your directive is, the less likely backroom is to misinterpret or vaguely interpret the directive, and this will lead to good outcomes for your cabinet. *Presence in Committee: *You were a moderately active participant in most committee sessions, which is commendable. You could look to raise more motions and use the ROP more intricately however to try and impose your authority even further during council sessions. We wish you all the best for the future and hope to see you continue your journey in debate. Yours sincerely, The Dais HJCC UK, Garladinne Aditya and Tarun Shankar."}, {"from": "Google <no-reply@accounts.google.com>", "subject": "Security alert", "email": "Google] Auto-Latex Equations was granted access to your Google Account gursimarbatra@gmail.com If you did not grant access, you should check this activity and secure your account.

In this email, we would like to inform you of a few important things to note in preparation for the upcoming conference from 3rd to 5th September 2021. Firstly, please find your name and allocation in the Allocations Matrix . In order to be safe in accordance with the MOH guidelines, all participants of NPSiMUN IX will be required to wear a mask at all times and adhere to all the COVID-19 Guidelines as mentioned in the attached NPSiMUN Guide. The Dais will be checking delegate temperatures twice a day and hence, all delegates are required to bring a digital thermometer. Do keep in mind that participants who have received a positive COVID test, come in contact with an infected individual one month prior to the conference or during the conference, or have a Quarantine Order/Stay Home Notice must notify the Secretariat immediately via email. Delegates who do not follow the strict social distancing rules in the Guide may be expelled from the conference. Understanding the short time frame within which research for the conference must take place, *NPSiMUN IX will not be having Position Papers*. While this means that no formal task will be demanded of delegates before the event, delegates are still expected to be well-versed in the agenda in relation to their delegation. To help you prepare, please find attached the Study Guide that will act as an effective launchpad for your research into the topic. However, do keep in mind it is by no means the only material that you should use to learn about the agenda or your stance. Also attached is the NPSiMUN Guide. This is an all-encompassing document that will help with almost anything you need to know for the conference. The NPSiMUN Guide has sections that detail key tactics such as lobbying and working paper introduction which may be particularly useful for those of you who are unfamiliar with the mechanisms of MUN. We strongly encourage you to read the Rules of Procedure section in its entirety as well and familiarize yourself with committee protocol to ensure the smooth running of council sessions. HJCC is a unique committee with different procedures and hence we strongly encourage all delegates to especially pay attention to the Specialised ROP component of Section 3. Keep referring to both Guides whenever you need to, and for further clarification do not hesitate to reach out to the Dais via this email ID. The Dais is looking forward to seeing all of you at the conference! Good luck with your preparation; we hope to see stimulating debate from all of you! For academic queries, do reach out to us at npsimun.hjccuk@gmail.com For administrative queries, contact the Secretariat at secretariat.npsimun@gmail.com Sincerely, Dais of HJCC: UK Aditya G, Tarun"}, {"from": "\"Shreyas Manchanda (via Google Sheets)\" <drive-shares-dm-noreply@google.com>", "subject": "Spreadsheet shared with you: \"[PUBLIC] Allocations Matrix\"", "email": "I've shared an item with you: Allocations Matrix It's not an attachment -- it's stored online.
