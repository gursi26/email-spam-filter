It may seem unusual at first, but as a student at Simon's Rock, you will address your professors by their first names. You will also meet them for coffee or a meal, run into them in town or at the dining hall, or chat with them during intermission at a concert. Professors like Ben, MaryAnn, Francisca, and Mike don't just teach; they advise, collaborate with, counsel, nurture, and mentor students. You'll come to think of them\u2014and they'll come to think of you\u2014as especially bright and interesting colleagues. And a deep mutual respect and admiration will develop. Because our professors are so accessible, you know that you can count on them to help you reach your educational goals. Along with that personal attention comes opportunities to co-author papers, conduct research, attend conferences, and stop in for some extra help or tutoring after class. That comfortable and familiar rapport between professors and students leads to better and more meaningful learning. Transform your teacher-student relationships.

I know because I was in your shoes just a couple years ago. I hope learning more about my experience can help in your decision-making process! WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO ATTEND COLLEGE OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOME COUNTRY? I went to a German-French high school, which really valued diversity. I grew up with a lot of friends from different countries and completely different backgrounds, which was a big reason I started looking at schools in other countries. I also wanted to keep playing soccer after high school and I knew that the US was the best country to combine an excellent education and my soccer career. HOW DID YOU DECIDE BUTLER WAS THE SCHOOL FOR YOU? I immediately knew that Butler was the school for me after my official visit. Everyone I met was so welcoming and outgoing and it just felt like home. Also, I really liked the campus because it was the perfect size--small enough that I would have a short walk from one class to the next, but large enough to still have tons of opportunities. WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR FAVORITE PARTS ABOUT BUTLER? The support system that Butler offers is truly unique and one of my favorite parts. I can always depend on my academic advisors, my professors, and everyone in the Office of International Student Services I also appreciate the small class sizes because you can build personal relationships with your professors. Outside of academics, I really enjoy living in my residence hall and watching exciting Butler basketball games with my friends. WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO A PROSPECTIVE INTERNATIONAL STUDENT? Going to college in a different country can be really intimidating. My biggest piece of advice is to be open to making friends. As an international student, people will want to get to know you and find out more about your country and your lifestyle. It's also really important to make sure you utilize support systems in place for international students like the Office of International Student Services. It's so comforting to know that there are people looking out for you and helping you make your college experience as enjoyable as possible. Good luck with your search and I hope you will join me on campus soon!

In collaboration with the Making Caring Common project, UConn is pleased to endorse Care Counts in Crisis a statement expressing what we and hundreds of other colleges and universities value in our applicants during this time of COVID-19. Self-care, academic work and engagement, service to others, family contributions, and extracurricular and summer activities are among those authentic and meaningful experiences that UConn's Office of Undergraduate Admissions will underscore as we seek to turn the tides on the application review process. We have also elected to become a testing-optional institution, beginning with undergraduate students applying for entry to the 2021-2022 academic year and continuing through the next two admission cycles. This will allow us to review important academic and personal qualities in even greater detail. UConn recognizes that each student's circumstances allow for different opportunities and limitations, which is why all academic and personal achievements will be assessed in the context of these obstacles. We hope this transparency will ease some of the stress that many students and families are currently experiencing and will encourage all future applicants to make caring common.

We recommend focusing on three key areas to uncover the important differences between schools and decide what's most important to you. Key #1. Academics Verifying that a school offers strong programs in your area of interest is a good start, but you need to dig deeper. Know your degree options and think about the learning environment. How do you learn best? Would you thrive in large lecture halls or in smaller classes, like those at Quinnipiac, where professors know you by name and can provide you with individual attention? Visit QU.edu to browse our Majors, Minors and Dual-Degree Programs Key #2. Student Experience A successful college experience transcends the classroom. Take some time to learn about university life at the schools you are considering. Go beyond the pictures of everyone having a great time and learn about the campus culture, student activities, athletics, student support services and housing options. Living at Quinnipiac Student Activities and Organizations Athletics and Recreation The QU Dining Experience Quinnipiac's Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion We incorporate inclusive excellence in everything we do to create a globally engaged, culturally rich and highly collaborative campus. Inclusion and diversity help our students develop empathy, compassion and appreciation for the differences that make the world a fuller place.Learn more Key #3. Exceptional Outcomes A college education is an investment in your future. Be sure your college experience prepares you for success with experiential learning and internship opportunities. A focus on your career development from day one and an active alumni network are also valuable assets that will accelerate your professional success. These opportunities and more await you at Quinnipiac.

Dr. Greider shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her pioneering work on telomeres, critical structures that maintain the ends of chromosomes, and the discovery of telomerase, the enzyme that maintains telomere length. Telomeres are stretches of repetitive DNA at the ends of chromosomes, often compared to the plastic tips that keep the ends of shoelaces from unraveling. Telomere shortening is associated with aging and age-related diseases. One of her current focus areas is studying degenerative human diseases caused by short telomeres. She will establish a NEW laboratory at UC Santa Cruz to continue her telomere research program. According to Dr. Greider, she was attracted to UC Santa Cruz both because of the excellence of our scientific research community, and because she wants to advocate for diversity in science. \"The science here in MCD Biology is fantastic, and I've been impressed by the rigorous training for graduate students,\" Dr. Greider said. \"I also see opportunities to make a difference in terms of underserved populations and women in science, which are issues I care a lot about and which seem to be part of the bedrock here at UCSC, not just something added on top, so that structures are set up to support efforts in those areas.\" Read more about Dr. Greider her interests, and what she loves about living in Santa Cruz.
